			<p class="fact">Sharks are a large group of fish that have inhabited the oceans for over 400 million years, even before dinosaurs populated our planet. They belong to the superorder Selachimorpha, and modern sharks have specific characteristics like a cartilaginous skeleton, five or six pairs of gills and several rows of teeth.</p>

			<p>The shark species as we know them have been around for 100 million years; this means that they were dwelling the oceans when dinosaurs were roaming the land. This record-breaking survival cannot be anything but astonishing, developing an anatomy during this time which only has improved over those million years of evolution.</p>
